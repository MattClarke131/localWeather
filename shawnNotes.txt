Shawn's Code Review of localWeather
================================================================================
1. Maybe hide the change scale button until weather info has returned.
  1.1. Another option: Have scale be checked when weather is first loaded.
    Maybe updateWeatherDisplay should care about the scale.
2. Make makexhr would be better named getWeather or something
3. Give user on page feedback when geolocation fails.
4. Replace empty temperature with something else when user rejects geolocation.
5. Change //Variables comment
6. multiple functions set the temperature. Have them all call setTemp();
7. Use consistent variable names. e.g. Only C and F, change celsius and
    farenheit
8. In convertTemp, I should move the newTemp declaration outside of the if
    statement. In other languages, that var would be accessible only within that
    if statement. Javascript uses "Hoisting" so it works here.
9. Declare weatherInfo and currentScale globally.
10. temperature should be declared "var temperature"
11. Look up "use strict" for javascript
12. if geolocation does not work in a browser, the call to it will still occur
